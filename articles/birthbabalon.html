                  <br/>
            (by John Whiteside Parsons, 1914-1952 e.v.)
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            What is the tumult among the stars
                  <br/>
            that have shone so still till now?
                  <br/>
            What are the furrows of pain and wrath
                  <br/>
            upon the immortal brow?
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Why is the face of God turned grey
                  <br/>
            and his angels all grown white?
                  <br/>
            What is the terrible ruby star
                  <br/>
            that burns down the crimson night?
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            What is the beauty that flames so bright
                  <br/>
            athwart the awful dawn?
                  <br/>
            She has taken flesh, she is come to judge
                  <br/>
            the thrones ye rule upon.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Quail ye kings for an end is come
                  <br/>
            in the birth of BABALON.

                  <br/>
            I have walked three dreadful nights away
                  <br/>
            in halls beyond despair,
                  <br/>
            I have given marrow and tears and sweat
                  <br/>
            and blood to make her fair.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            I have lain my love and smashed my heart
                  <br/>
            and filled her cup with blood,
                  <br/>
            That blood might flow from the loins of woe
                  <br/>
            to the cup of brotherhood.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            The cities reel in the shout of steel
                  <br/>
            where the sword of war is drawn.
                  <br/>
            Sing ye saints for the day is come
                  <br/>
            in the birth of BABALON.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>

                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Now God has called for his judgement book
                  <br/>
            and seen his name therein
                  <br/>
            And the grace of God and the guilt of God
                  <br/>
            have spelt it out as sin
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            His bloody priests have clutched his robes
                  <br/>
            and stained his linen gown
                  <br/>
            And his victims swarm from his broken hell
                  <br/>
            to drag his kingdom down.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            O popes and kings and the little gods
                  <br/>
            are sick and sad and wan
                  <br/>
            To see the crimson star that bursts
                  <br/>
            like blood upon the dawn
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            While trumpets sound and stars rejoice
                  <br/>
            at the birth of BABALON
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            *
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            BABALON is too beautiful
                  <br/>
            for sight of mortal eyes
                  <br/>
            She has hidden her loveliness away
                  <br/>
            in lonely midnight skies,
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            She has clothed her beauty in robes of sin
                  <br/>
            and pledged her heart to swine
                  <br/>
            And loving and giving all she has
                  <br/>
            brewed for saints immortal wine.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            But now the darkness is riven through
                  <br/>
            and the robes of sin are gone,
                  <br/>
            And naked she stands as a terrible blade
                  <br/>
            and a flame and a splendid song
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Naked in radiant mortal flesh
                  <br/>
            at the Birth of BABALON.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            *
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            She is come new born as a mortal maid
                  <br/>
            forgetting her high estate,
                  <br/>
            She has opened her arms to pain and death
                  <br/>
            and dared the doom of fate,
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            And death and hell are at her back,
                  <br/>
            but her eyes are bright with life,
                  <br/>
            Her heart is high and her sword is strong
                  <br/>
            to meet the deadly strife,
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Her voice is sure as the judgement trump
                  <br/>
            to crack the house of wrong,
                  <br/>
            Though walls are high and stone is hard
                  <br/>
            and the rule of hell was long
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            The gates shall fall and the irons break
                  <br/>
            in the Birth of BABALON
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            *
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Her mouth is red and her breasts are fair
                  <br/>
            and her loins are full of fire,
                  <br/>
            And her lust is strong as a man is strong
                  <br/>
            in the heat of her desire,
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            And her whoredom is holy as virtue is foul
                  <br/>
            beneath the holy sky
                  <br/>
            And her kisses will wanton the world away
                  <br/>
            in passion that shall not die.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Ye shall laugh and love and follow her dance
                  <br/>
            When the wrath of God is gone
                  <br/>
            And dream no more of hell and hate
                  <br/>
            in the Birth of BABALON
                  <br/>
