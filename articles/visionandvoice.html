            <h1>Extracts from the Vision and the Voice</h1>
                <p>
            (by The Master Therion)
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            From Oxo, the 15th Aethyr:
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Lo! I gather up every spirit that is pure, and weave him into my vesture of flame. I lick up the lives of men, and their souls sparkle from mine eyes. I am the mighty sorceress, the lust of the spirit. And by my dancing I gather for my mother Nuit the heads of all them that are baptized in the waters of life. I am the lust of the spirit that eateth up the soul of man. I have prepared a feast for the adepts, and they that partake thereof shall see God.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            From Loe, the 12th Aethyr:
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            This is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of Abominations and this is the mystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself to everything that liveth, and hath become a partaker in its mystery. And because she hath made herself the servant of each, therefore is she mistress of all. Not yet canst thou comprehend her glory.
                  <br/>
            Beautiful art thou, O Babalon, and desirable, for thou hast given thyself to everything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength. For in that union thou didst understand. Therefore art thou called Understanding, O Babylon, Lady of the Night.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            This is that which is written, "O my God, in one last rapture let me attain to the union with the many." For she is Love, and her love is one, and she hath divided the one love into infinite loves, and each love is one, and equal to The One, and therefore is she passed "from the assembly and the law and the enlightenment unto the anarchy of solitude and darkness. For ever thus must she veil the brilliance of Her Self." O Babylon, Babylon, thou mighty Mother, that ridest upon the crown d beast, let me be drunken upon the wine of thy fornications; let thy kisses wanton me unto death, that even I, thy cup-bearer, may understand.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            From Zip, the 9th Aethyr:
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            This is the daughter of Babalon the Beautiful, that she hath borne unto the Father of All. And unto all hath she borne her. This is the Daughter of the King. This is the Virgin of Eternity. This is she that the Holy One hath wrested from the Giant Time, and the prize of them that have overcome Space. This is she that is set upon the Throne of Understanding. Holy, Holy, Holy is her name, not to be spoken among men. For Kor they have called her, and Malkuth, and Betulah, and Persephone.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            And the poets have feigned songs about her, and the prophets have spoken vain things, and the young men have dreamed vain dreams; but this is she, that immaculate, the name of whose name may not be spoken. Thought cannot pierce the glory that defendeth her, for thought is smitten dead before her presence. Memory is blank, and in the most ancient books of Magick are neither words to conjure her, nor adorations to praise her. Will bends like a reed in the temptests that sweep the borders of her kingdom, and imagination cannot figure so much as one petal of the lilies whereon she standeth in the lake of crystal, in the sea of glass.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            This is she that hath bedecked her hair with seven stars, the seven breaths of God that move and thrill its excellence. And she hath tired her hair with seven combs, whereupon are written the seven secret names of God that are not known even of the Angels, or of the Archangels, or of the Leader of the armies of the Lord.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            Holy, Holy, Holy art thou, and blessed be Thy name for ever, unto whom the Aeons are but the pulsings of thy blood.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            From Paz, the 4th Aethyr:
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            O Nox,
                  <br/>
            Nox qui celas infamiam infandi nefandi,
                  <br/>
            Deo solo sit laus qui dedit signum non scribendum.
                  <br/>
            Laus virgini cuius stuprum tradit salutem.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            From Arn, the 2nd Aethyr:
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            I am the harlot that shaketh Death.
                  <br/>
            This shaking giveth the Peace of Satiate Lust.
                  <br/>
            Immortality jetteth from my skull,
                  <br/>
            And music from my vulva.
                  <br/>
            Immortality jetteth from my vulva also,
                  <br/>
            For my Whoredom is a sweet scent like a seven-stringed instrument,
                  <br/>
            Played unto God the Invisible, the all-ruler,
                  <br/>
            That goeth along giving the shrill scream of orgasm.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            And that which thou hearest is but the dropping of the dews from my limbs, for I dance in the night, naked upon the grass, in shadowy places, by running streams.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>

            The Vision and the Voice is the record of Aleister Crowley's progression through the thirty aethyrs of Enochian kozmology, which he undertook during a trek across Algeria in 1909 with Frater O.V (Victor Neuburg). Crowley scryed the aethyrs using a great golden topaz (set in a Calvary Cross of six squares, made of wood, and painted vermillion) which was engraved with a Greek Cross of five squares charged with the Rose of 49 petals. After choosing a spot where he was not likely to be disturbed, he would take the shewstone, recite the appropriate Enochian Call, scry the aethyr, and relate his vision to the Scribe, Frater O.V. The two men walked steadily through the desert, progresssing through the aethyrs, one by one, usually at the rate of one a day. The visions for each aethyr are rich in symbolism, but the 16th, 15th, 12th, 7th 4th, and 2nd aethyrs are particularly important, as they involve encounters with Babalon. It was during this series of visions that Crowley discovered the true name of the goddess. He referred to Her as Babylon in the initial visions, but it was not until the tenth aethyr had been scryed that Crowley was made aware of Her true name, Babalon.
