                <p>Translated by George W. MacRae
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            I was sent forth from the power,
                  <br/>
            and I have come to those who reflect upon me,
                  <br/>
            and I have been found among those who seek after me.
                  <br/>
            Look upon me, you who reflect upon me,
                  <br/>
            and you hearers, hear me.
                  <br/>
            You who are waiting for me, take me to yourselves.
                  <br/>
            And do not banish me from your sight.
                  <br/>
            And do not make your voice hate me, nor your hearing.
                  <br/>
            Do not be ignorant of me anywhere or any time. Be on your guard!
                  <br/>
            Do not be ignorant of me.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
            For I am the first and the last.
                  <br/>
            I am the honored one and the scorned one.
                  <br/>
            I am the whore and the holy one.
                  <br/>
            I am the wife and the virgin.
                  <br/>
            I am 
                  <the mother> and the daughter.
                    <br/>
            I am the members of my mother.
                    <br/>
            I am the barren one
                    <br/>
            and many are her sons.
                    <br/>
            I am she whose wedding is great,
                    <br/>
            and I have not taken a husband.
                    <br/>
            I am the midwife and she who does not bear.
                    <br/>
            I am the solace of my labor pains.
                    <br/>
            I am the bride and the bridegroom,
                    <br/>
            and it is my husband who begot me.
                    <br/>
            I am the mother of my father
                    <br/>
            and the sister of my husband
                    <br/>
            and he is my offspring.
                    <br/>
            I am the slave of him who prepared me.
                    <br/>
            I am the ruler of my offspring.
                    <br/>
            But he is the one who begot me before the time on a birthday.
                    <br/>
            And he is my offspring in (due) time,
                    <br/>
            and my power is from him.
                    <br/>
            I am the staff of his power in his youth,
                    <br/>
            and he is the rod of my old age.
                    <br/>
            And whatever he wills happens to me.
                    <br/>
            I am the silence that is incomprehensible
                    <br/>
            and the idea whose remembrance is frequent.
                    <br/>
            I am the voice whose sound is manifold
                    <br/>
            and the word whose appearance is multiple.
                    <br/>
            I am the utterance of my name.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            Why, you who hate me, do you love me,
                    <br/>
            and hate those who love me?
                    <br/>
            You who deny me, confess me,
                    <br/>
            and you who confess me, deny me.
                    <br/>
            You who tell the truth about me, lie about me,
                    <br/>
            and you who have lied about me, tell the truth about me.
                    <br/>
            You who know me, be ignorant of me,
                    <br/>
            and those who have not known me, let them know me.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            For I am knowledge and ignorance.
                    <br/>
            I am shame and boldness.
                    <br/>
            I am shameless; I am ashamed.
                    <br/>
            I am strength and I am fear.
                    <br/>
            I am war and peace.
                    <br/>
            Give heed to me.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            I am the one who is disgraced and the great one.
                    <br/>
            Give heed to my poverty and my wealth.
                    <br/>
            Do not be arrogant to me when I am cast out upon the earth,
                    <br/>
            and you will find me in those that are to come.
                    <br/>
            And do not look upon me on the dung-heap
                    <br/>
            nor go and leave me cast out,
                    <br/>
            and you will find me in the kingdoms.
                    <br/>
            And do not look upon me when I am cast out among those who
                    <br/>
            are disgraced and in the least places,
                    <br/>
            nor laugh at me.
                    <br/>
            And do not cast me out among those who are slain in violence.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            But I, I am compassionate and I am cruel.
                    <br/>
            Be on your guard!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            Do not hate my obedience
                    <br/>
            and do not love my self-control.
                    <br/>
            In my weakness, do not forsake me,
                    <br/>
            and do not be afraid of my power.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            For why do you despise my fear
                    <br/>
            and curse my pride?
                    <br/>
            But I am she who exists in all fears
                    <br/>
            and strength in trembling.
                    <br/>
            I am she who is weak,
                    <br/>
            and I am well in a pleasant place.
                    <br/>
            I am senseless and I am wise.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            Why have you hated me in your counsels?
                    <br/>
            For I shall be silent among those who are silent,
                    <br/>
            and I shall appear and speak,
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            Why then have you hated me, you Greeks?
                    <br/>
            Because I am a barbarian among the barbarians?
                    <br/>
            For I am the wisdom of the Greeks
                    <br/>
            and the knowledge of the barbarians.
                    <br/>
            I am the judgement of the Greeks and of the barbarians.
                    <br/>
            I am the one whose image is great in Egypt
                    <br/>
            and the one who has no image among the barbarians.
                    <br/>
            I am the one who has been hated everywhere
                    <br/>
            and who has been loved everywhere.
                    <br/>
            I am the one whom they call Life,
                    <br/>
            and you have called Death.
                    <br/>
            I am the one whom they call Law,
                    <br/>
            and you have called Lawlessness.
                    <br/>
            I am the one whom you have pursued,
                    <br/>
            and I am the one whom you have seized.
                    <br/>
            I am the one whom you have scattered,
                    <br/>
            and you have gathered me together.
                    <br/>
            I am the one before whom you have been ashamed,
                    <br/>
            and you have been shameless to me.
                    <br/>
            I am she who does not keep festival,
                    <br/>
            and I am she whose festivals are many.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            I, I am godless,
                    <br/>
            and I am the one whose God is great.
                    <br/>
            I am the one whom you have reflected upon,
                    <br/>
            and you have scorned me.
                    <br/>
            I am unlearned,
                    <br/>
            and they learn from me.
                    <br/>
            I am the one that you have despised,
                    <br/>
            and you reflect upon me.
                    <br/>
            I am the one whom you have hidden from,
                    <br/>
            and you appear to me.
                    <br/>
            But whenever you hide yourselves,
                    <br/>
            I myself will appear.
                    <br/>
            For whenever you appear,
                    <br/>
            I myself will hide from you.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            Those who have [...] to it [...] senselessly [...].
                    <br/>
            Take me [... understanding] from grief.
                    <br/>
            and take me to yourselves from understanding and grief.
                    <br/>
            And take me to yourselves from places that are ugly and in ruin,
                    <br/>
            and rob from those which are good even though in ugliness.
                    <br/>
            Out of shame, take me to yourselves shamelessly;
                    <br/>
            and out of shamelessness and shame,
                    <br/>
            upbraid my members in yourselves.
                    <br/>
            And come forward to me, you who know me
                    <br/>
            and you who know my members,
                    <br/>
            and establish the great ones among the small first creatures.
                    <br/>
            Come forward to childhood,
                    <br/>
            and do not despise it because it is small and it is little.
                    <br/>
            And do not turn away greatnesses in some parts from the smallnesses,
                    <br/>
            for the smallnesses are known from the greatnesses.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            Why do you curse me and honor me?
                    <br/>
            You have wounded and you have had mercy.
                    <br/>
            Do not separate me from the first ones whom you have known.
                    <br/>
            And do not cast anyone out nor turn anyone away
                    <br/>
            [...] turn you away and [... know] him not.
                    <br/>
            [...].
                    <br/>
            What is mine [...].
                    <br/>
            I know the first ones and those after them know me.
                    <br/>
            But I am the mind of [...] and the rest of [...].
                    <br/>
            I am the knowledge of my inquiry,
                    <br/>
            and the finding of those who seek after me,
                    <br/>
            and the command of those who ask of me,
                    <br/>
            and the power of the powers in my knowledge
                    <br/>
            of the angels, who have been sent at my word,
                    <br/>
            and of gods in their seasons by my counsel,
                    <br/>
            and of spirits of every man who exists with me,
                    <br/>
            and of women who dwell within me.
                    <br/>
            I am the one who is honored, and who is praised,
                    <br/>
            and who is despised scornfully.
                    <br/>
            I am peace,
                    <br/>
            and war has come because of me.
                    <br/>
            And I am an alien and a citizen.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            I am the substance and the one who has no substance.
                    <br/>
            Those who are without association with me are ignorant of me,
                    <br/>
            and those who are in my substance are the ones who know me.
                    <br/>
            Those who are close to me have been ignorant of me,
                    <br/>
            and those who are far away from me are the ones who have known me.
                    <br/>
            On the day when I am close to you, you are far away from me,
                    <br/>
            and on the day when I am far away from you, I am close to you.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            [I am ...] within.
                    <br/>
            [I am ...] of the natures.
                    <br/>
            I am [...] of the creation of the spirits.
                    <br/>
            [...] request of the souls.
                    <br/>
            I am control and the uncontrollable.
                    <br/>
            I am the union and the dissolution.
                    <br/>
            I am the abiding and I am the dissolution.
                    <br/>
            I am the one below,
                    <br/>
            and they come up to me.
                    <br/>
            I am the judgment and the acquittal.
                    <br/>
            I, I am sinless,
                    <br/>
            and the root of sin derives from me.
                    <br/>
            I am lust in (outward) appearance,
                    <br/>
            and interior self-control exists within me.
                    <br/>
            I am the hearing which is attainable to everyone
                    <br/>
            and the speech which cannot be grasped.
                    <br/>
            I am a mute who does not speak,
                    <br/>
            and great is my multitude of words.
                    <br/>
            Hear me in gentleness, and learn of me in roughness.
                    <br/>
            I am she who cries out,
                    <br/>
            and I am cast forth upon the face of the earth.
                    <br/>
            I prepare the bread and my mind within.
                    <br/>
            I am the knowledge of my name.
                    <br/>
            I am the one who cries out,
                    <br/>
            and I listen.
                    <br/>
            I appear and [...] walk in [...] seal of my [...].
                    <br/>
            I am [...] the defense [...].
                    <br/>
            I am the one who is called Truth
                    <br/>
            and iniquity [...].
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            You honor me [...] and you whisper against me.
                    <br/>
            You who are vanquished, judge them (who vanquish you)
                    <br/>
            before they give judgment against you,
                    <br/>
            because the judge and partiality exist in you.
                    <br/>
            If you are condemned by this one, who will acquit you?
                    <br/>
            Or, if you are acquitted by him, who will be able to detain you?
                    <br/>
            For what is inside of you is what is outside of you,
                    <br/>
            and the one who fashions you on the outside
                    <br/>
            is the one who shaped the inside of you.
                    <br/>
            And what you see outside of you, you see inside of you;
                    <br/>
            it is visible and it is your garment.
                    <br/>
            Hear me, you hearers
                    <br/>
            and learn of my words, you who know me.
                    <br/>
            I am the hearing that is attainable to everything;
                    <br/>
            I am the speech that cannot be grasped.
                    <br/>
            I am the name of the sound
                    <br/>
            and the sound of the name.
                    <br/>
            I am the sign of the letter
                    <br/>
            and the designation of the division.
                    <br/>
            And I [...].
                    <br/>
            (3 lines missing)
                    <br/>
            [...] light [...].
                    <br/>
            [...] hearers [...] to you
                    <br/>
            [...] the great power.
                    <br/>
            And [...] will not move the name.
                    <br/>
            [...] to the one who created me.
                    <br/>
            And I will speak his name.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
            Look then at his words
                    <br/>
            and all the writings which have been completed.
                    <br/>
            Give heed then, you hearers
                    <br/>
            and you also, the angels and those who have been sent,
                    <br/>
            and you spirits who have arisen from the dead.
                    <br/>
            For I am the one who alone exists,
                    <br/>
            and I have no one who will judge me.
                    <br/>
            For many are the pleasant forms which exist in numerous sins,
                    <br/>
            and incontinencies,
                    <br/>
            and disgraceful passions,
                    <br/>
            and fleeting pleasures,
                    <br/>
            which (men) embrace until they become sober
                    <br/>
            and go up to their resting place.
                    <br/>
            And they will find me there,
                    <br/>
            and they will live,
                    <br/>
            and they will not die again.
