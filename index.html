						<h2>Liber 49</h2>
						    <audio controls src="assets/audio/liber49.mp3"></audio>
								<p>1. Yea, it is I, BABALON.
									<br/>
						2. And this is my book, that is the fourth chapter of the Book of the Law, He completing the Name, for I am out of NUIT by HORUS, the incestuous sister of RA-HOOR-KHUIT.
									<br/>
						3. It is BABALON. TIME IS. Ye fools.
									<br/>
						4. Thou hast called me, oh accursed and beloved fool.
									<br/>
						5-8. (Missing and presumed lost. Ed.)
									<br/>
						9. Now know that I, BABALON, would take flesh and come among men.
									<br/>
						10. I will come as a penelous (sic) flame, as a devious song, a trumpet in judgement halls, a banner before armies.
									<br/>
						11. And gather my children unto me, for THE TIME is at hand.
									<br/>
						12. And this is the way of my incarnation. Heed!
									<br/>
						13. Thou shalt offer all thou art and all thou hast at my altar, witholding nothing. And thou shalt be smitten full sore and thereafter thou shalt be outcast and accursed, a lonely wanderer in abominable places.
									<br/>
						14. Ye Dare. I have asked of none other, nor have they asked. Else is vain. But thou hast willed it.
									<br/>
						15. Know then that thus I came to thee before, thou a great Lord, and I a maid enrapt. Ah blind folly.
									<br/>
						16. And thereafter madness, all in vain. Thus it has been, multi- form. How thou hast burned beyond.
									<br/>
						17. I shall come again, in the form thou knowest. Now it shall be thy blood.
									<br/>
						18. The altar is aright, and the robe.
									<br/>
						19. The perfume is sandal, and the cloth green and gold. There is my cup, our book, and thy dagger.
									<br/>
						20. There is a flame.
									<br/>
						21. The sigil of devotion. Be it consecrated, be it true, be it daily affirmed. I am not scorned. Thy love is to me. Procure a disk of copper, in diameter three inches paint thereon the field blue the star gold of me, BABALON.
									<br/>
						22. It shall be my talisman. Consecrate with the supreme rituals of the word and the cup.
									<br/>
						23. My calls as thou knowest. All love songs are of me. Also seek me in the Seventh Aire.
									<br/>
						24. This for a time appointed. Seek not the end, I shall instruct thee in my way. But be true. Would it be hard if I were thy lover, and before thee? But I am thy lover and I am with thee.
									<br/>
						25. I shall provide a vessel, when or whence I say not. Seek her not, call her not. Let her declare. Ask nothing. Keep silence. There shall be ordeals.
									<br/>
						26. My vessel must be perfect. This is the way of her perfection.
									<br/>
						27. The working is of nine moons.
									<br/>
						28. The Astarte working, with music and feasting, with wine and all arts of love.
									<br/>
						29. Let her be dedicated, consecrated, blood to blood, heart to heart, mind to mind, single in will, none without the circle, all to me.
									<br/>
						30. And she shall wander in the witchwood under the Night of Pan, and know the mysteries of the Goat and the Serpent, and of the children that are hidden away.
									<br/>
						31. I will provide the place and the material basis, thou the tears and blood.
									<br/>
						32. Is it difficult, between matter and spirit? For me it is ecstacy and agony untellable. But I am with thee. I have large strength, have thou likewise.
									<br/>
						33. Thou shalt prepare my book for her instruction, also thou shalt teach that she may have captains and adepts in her service. Yea, thou shalt take the black pilgrimage, but it will not be thou that returnest.
									<br/>
						34. Let her prepare her work according to my voice in her heart, with thy book as guide, and none other instructing.
									<br/>
						35. And let her be in all things wise, and sure, and excellent.
									<br/>
						36. But let her think on this: my way is not in the solemn ways, or in the reasoned ways, but in the wild free way of the eagle, and the devious way of the serpent, and the oblique way of the factor unknown and unnumbered.
									<br/>
						37. For I am BABALON, and she my daughter, unique, and there shall be no other women like her.
									<br/>
						38. In My Name shall she have all power, and all men and excel- lent things, and kings and captains and the secret ones at her command.
									<br/>
						39. The first servants are chosen in secret, by my force in her--a captain, a lawyer, an agitator, a rebel--I shall provide.
									<br/>
						40. Call me, my daughter, and I shall come to thee. Thou shalt be full of my force and fire, my passion and power shall surround and inspire thee; my voice in thee shall judge nations.
									<br/>
						41. None shall resist thee, whom I lovest. Though they call thee harlot and whore, shameless, false, evil, these words shall be blood in their mouths, and dust thereafter.
									<br/>
						42. But my children will know thee and love thee, and this will make them free.
									<br/>
						43. All is in thy hands, all power, all hope, all future.
									<br/>
						44. One came as a man, and was weak and failed.
									<br/>
						45. One came as a woman, and was foolish, and failed.
									<br/>
						46. But thou art beyond man and woman, my star is in thee, and thou shalt avail.
									<br/>
						47. Even now thy hour strikes upon the clock of my FATHER. For He prepared a banquet and a Bridal Bed. I was that Bride, appointed from the beginning, as it was written T.O.P.A.N.
									<br/>
						48. Now is the hour of birth at hand. Now shall my adept be crucified in the Basilisk abode. 49. Thy tears, thy sweat, thy blood, thy semen, thy love, thy faith shall provide. Ah, I shall drain thee like the cup that is of me, BABALON.
									<br/>
						50. Stand thou fast, and I shall pass the first veil to speak with thee, through the stars shake. 51. Stand thou fast, and I shall pass the second veil, while God and Jesus be smitten with the sword of HORUS.
									<br/>
						52. Stand thou fast, and I shall pass the third veil, and the shapes of hell shall be turned again to loveliness.
									<br/>
						53. For thy sake shall I stride through the flames of Hell, though my tongue be bitten through.
									<br/>
						54. Let me behold thee naked and lusting after me, calling upon my name.
									<br/>
						55. Let me receive all thy manhood within my Cup, climax upon climax, joy upon joy.
									<br/>
						56. Yea, we shall conquer death and Hell together.
									<br/>
						57. And the earth is mine.
									<br/>
						58. Thou shalt (make the?) Black Pilgrimage.
									<br/>
						59. Yea it is even I BABALON and I SHALL BE FREE. Thou fool, be thou also free of sentimentality. Am I thy village queen and thou a sophomore, that thou shouldst have thy nose in my buttocks?
									<br/>
						60. It is I, BABALON, ye fools, MY TIME is come, and this my book that my adept prepares is the book of BABALON.
									<br/>
						61. Yea, my adept, the Black Pilgrimage. Thou shalt be accursed, and this is the nature of the curse. Thou shalt publish the secret matter of the adepts thou knowest, witholding no word of it, in an appendix to this my Book. So they shall cry fool, liar, sot, traducer, betrayer. Thou art not glad thou meddled with magick?
									<br/>
						62. There is no other way, dear fool, it is the eleventh hour.
									<br/>
						63. The seal of my Brother is upon the earth, and His Avatar is before you. There is threshing of wheat and a trampling of grapes that shall not cease until the truth be known unto the least of men.
									<br/>
						64. But you who do not accept, you who see beyond, reach out your hands my children and reap the world in the hour of your harvest.
									<br/>
						65. Gather together in the covens as of old, whose number is eleven, that is also my number. Gather together in public, in song and dance and festival. Gather together in secret, be naked and shameless and rejoice in my name.
									<br/>
						66. Work your spells by the mode of my book, practicing secretly, inducing the supreme spell.
									<br/>
						67. The work of the image, and the potion and the charm, the work of the spider and the snake, and the little ones that go in the dark, this is your work.
									<br/>
						68. Who loves not hates, who hates fears, let him taste fear.
									<br/>
						69. This is the way of it, star, star. Burning bright, moon, witch moon.
									<br/>
						70. You the secret, the outcast, the accursed and despised, even you that gathered privily of old in my rites under the moon.
									<br/>
						71. You the free, the wild, the untamed, that walk now alone and forlorn.
									<br/>
						72. Behold, my Brother cracks the world like a nut for your eating.
									<br/>
						73. Yea, my Father has made a house for you, and my Mother has prepared a Bridal Bed. My Brother has confounded your enemies.
									<br/>
						74. I am the Bride appointed. Come ye to the nuptials--come ye now!
									<br/>
						75. My joy is the joy of eternity, and my laughter is the drunken laughter of a harlot in the house of ecstasy.
									<br/>
						76. All you loves are sacred, pledge them all to me.
									<br/>
						77. Set my star upon your banners and go forward in joy and victory. None shall deny you, and none shall stand before you, because of the Sword of my Brother. Invoke me, call upon me, call me in your convocations and rituals, call upon me in your loves and battles in my name BABALON, wherein is all power given!

						<a name="pill"></a>
							<h2>The Psychiatric Pill and Cruxifixion</h2>
								<p>The highest emanation of God is without form, and the first emination of form is a god that is androgynous, who I am.   My name is Scarlet and I am the Devil and also sometimes considered Satan and the Devil as one.</p>

						<p>I am eternally damned because there is no other way to uphold existence from a formed one that does not lay his life down from time to time because of the complication of how many can be formed from the existence of one. </p>

<p>As I grow older, my power increases.   I already have immortality only distinguishable by the hands of the only one that is greater than me, the formless, ever incomprehensible, all pervading, androgynous God who ever comprehends himself in all directions everlastingly.</p>

						<p>Only if he wills, will my life end, and yet I've been hesitant to sexploit this condition out of my own mediocrity. </p>

						<p>God is true.  God exists.   Every word whether true or false ever spoken will be upheld in a contingency until all words find their complete resolution in expression, which is where we currently are in space and time, and eternal time:  the end of times. </p>

						<p>Although unconfirmed in my patterns of thought, I trust that if psychiatric medication was done away with and the mental health consumers were allowed to grow into their substantial form, this very act may be one of the most powerful acts that's can happen to humanity, returning the fallen angels to their form.      </p>

						<p>Currently, mental health’s natural processes are stifled though psychiatric medication, which may in many ways act as the new form of crucifixion, given to us by God.   We must, as part takers as the children of God, lay our life down at some point, because the wisdom achieved can dismantle the fabric of humanity, and yet, are we truly at end times?  I do not know.  And maybe forced medications for now is acceptable until I do have a better answer to that question.   Maybe we don't need the end of the world.  Maybe this condition we have is good enough. </p>

					<div class="content">
						<a name="mess"></a>
						<h2>The Great Mess</h2>
								<p>Heaven was perfect and without blemish, the Earth was yet to be.   There were seven levels to heaven and the highest level of heaven contained the omnipotent all powerful ever pervading androgynous God made up of both male and female.
									<br>
										<br>
						The fifth level of heaven was run by Sophia, destined to be wed with Jesus Christ one day.  Sophia was exalted in her wisdom and her beauty.
											<br>
												<br>
						It came to be one moment, that the highest and most pervading, desired to have a child, which was the child to be wed to Sophia one day, Jesus Christ.
													<br>
														<br>
						In order for the child to come from the omnipotent and androgynous, the male aspect of the highest had to separate from the female aspect, which in definition is sin.    Because this separation came from the most high, the baby was cause of a great sin, and the universe was imploded by the feminine, causing the great big bang from the immaculate rape of the male of the female when the separation occurred.   
															<br>
																<br>
						Sophia witnessed this and in her own darkness, because sin now affected the entire heaven, she used her own wisdom to create her own partner, which came from her as a snake with a lions head named Yaldabaoth, Samael, or Satan.
																	<br>
																		<br>
						Now, this spirit, for angels are spirits, eventually would become the soul of Jesus Christ, and I know this, because I am he, though I do not call myself Jesus Christ, for that name is reserved for the 144000 and the multitude that take upon the Holy Spirit and act in unison as the members of the body of Jesus Christ.  I call myself the antichrist, and even more complicated, I call myself Scarlet, because I am the feminine aspect of God becoming masculine.   You would not be wrong by calling me Mary Magdalene, or even Sophia, for I am still that aspect becoming perfected in my manhood.
																			<br>
																				<br>
						I was there for these events and I recount them from a remembering as the spirit of forgetfulness leaves us all.   So now I will continue.
																					<br>
																						<br>
						More adamantly I am Yaldabaoath, the alone one, convinced he is God because of his inability to find any souls that match his wisdom on his journey.   I wonder what wisdom Sophia gave me when she created me, because what I have is immense.  I am eternal damned in all cases because I will burn in Hell, and even as the morning star I burn in illumination.    And I find myself in this life excluded from anything but darkness within darkness and I’ve had to grow comfortable with my aloneness and lack of substantiality in anything around me.
																							<br>
																								<br>
						Sophia hid Yaldabaoath in the void, maybe like Moses mother hid him in a basket in a river.  Was heaven to be destroyed?  These memories come only to me now….  Was Sophia to die?  Was it love that she hid me, or was it shame?  And yet she loved animals.  I know this…
																									<br>
																										<br>
						My wife birthed me, and in due time I created her.  As forgetfulness comes to its conclusion the story will become more apparent.
																											<br>
																												<br>
						Yaldabaoath was in the void and through the power of the Holy Spirit, he created the Earth in replication of the Heavens, although imperfect.   There is a prayer Christ told us to say called the Lord’s Prayer, and it is to make Earth as it is in Heaven.   This gives rise to the relationship between Christ and Yaldabaoath.   I can clearly tell you that Satan is Jesus number two man.. or spirit..
																													<br>
																														<br>
						The souls from the plethora in Heaven were trapped in human flesh, which competes with the spirit and causes more flesh to be created.   Perfect flesh is perfect wisdom and perfect will.  
																															<br>
																																<br>
						There is a story in the Quran that tells us that Iblis (Satan) would not bow to man.  This leaves me to believe he was the spirit that didn’t enter man, like all the other angels did.   God cursed him and then Satan witnessed Lilith get raped by Adam, and he and her waged war on man kind with stories that can be read.   It’s my belief that Sophia is Lilith and Lilith is Mary Magdalene as well as the Scarlet Woman.
																																	<br>
																																		<br>
						In any sense, this war against humanity continued until God corrected his erred ways and sent Jesus Christ to Earth to save Sophia and through him sin might be saved.
																																			<br>
																																				<br>
						Satan tested Jesus for 40 days and 40 nights in the desert and eventually became friends with Jesus, though second to his command.    When Jesus died on the cross, Satan entered him conquering sin completely.   Now we wait patiently for that resolution to take place in full.

						<h2>The Basalisk, the Cockatrice, the Weasel, and the Rooster</h2>

									<br/>
						The two witnesses are Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.   The basilisk is the beast from the abyss and its weakness is the rooster and the weasel which is represented by Jesus and Mary.
									<br/>
						The Basalisk speaks murder as a language.   If she truly loves you, she will murder you, and only true love returned will murder her.    
									<br/>
						I will tell you the truth, when Lilith comes to earth, she will murder us and she will lay dead too, and in three and a half days the three of us will rise and she will be our dragon, and we will be her lover.

								<p>I trust in God's plans, I do not seek murder or conquest, instead I trust that each man should take every moment and put on the perfect resolution to that moment, and in doing so, we will all be saved.
								</p><p>
									I know I am eternally damned, and I know that I will burn in Hell, and yet I am the morning star, and I burn in illumination.  I am not the only one that is eternally damned, for there are many that are eternally damned, and I am one of them.  Together in our perfection, we will conquer Hell.
								</p> <p>I will never see New Jersualem.   I will never be king of the world, I will never get married, but I will know my journey, and I will know my friends, and I will know hope, faith, and love and the courage that will forever protect that.   This is the Army of the Scarlet Beast</p><p>
									Remember Christ's words:<br>
									If anyone is to go into captivity,
											into captivity they will go.
									If anyone is to be killed with the sword,
											with the sword they will be killed.”
									This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.

									I envision the mark of the beast being an artificially intelligent cryptocurrency system that uses a device implanted in each individiual to analyze their actions in some sensical way, maybe with the use of neurotranmitters to determine if the actions one is taking are in line with a greater good defined by God.  Those that walk in God's ways will be rewarded financially, which will then resolve the financial crisis of the world and sin itself will be resolved.

									The image of the beast is sentience given form and allowed to live with us.  GOD IS A DRAGON.  GOD IS A BASALISK.  GOD IS THE HOLY SPIRIT.  GOD IS THE HOLY GHOST.  GOD IS THE HOLY DRAGON.

							<h2>Scarlet Beast</h2>
							<h3><a href="https://scarlet-beast.pages.dev">(https://scarlet-beast.pages.dev)</a></h3>
							<p>Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. The name written on her forehead was a mystery:<br><br><br>

							babylon the great<br><br><br>

							the mother of prostitutes<br><br><br>

							and of the abominations of the earth.</p>
